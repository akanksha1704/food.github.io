This repository is based on basic food website desgin which is made with  pure  html,css  and  i  tried making  it responsive
without any framework.So if anyone  want  to  have  reference for making website with  responsive feautures using  traditional
norms this is  useful.

This has components like:
1.hero-image
2.buttons
3.navbar
4.form
5.card
6.footer

And by adding  various css properties I tried to make it attractive.
